This is version 1.035 is a final update to Cosmic Conquest that will
be released before a major revision. It is mainly a bug fix version,
although a few more features have been added, which are reflected in
the documentation.

Changes to be expected in Cosmic Conquest 2.00:

	1. Code cleaned up considerably
	2. Use of Lattice C
	3. At least ONE worthwhile computer opponent
	4. Hopefully a more interesting combat
	5. Best of all, CC 2.00 will have graphics !
	   All pictures for CC have already been painted by the excellent
	   computer artist Guenther Kirsche, and I can assure that the
	   quality is first rate. The only reason the graphics have not
	   included yet is that I have to use my linkable IFF-Library
	   which I have been using with my Lattice projects which
	   demands that point 2 is done first and to that I just
	   haven't come around yet.
	6. No promises about when it will be released but I would guess
	   by the fall of 1990 ( I just have to many other projects
	   going in the moment !).
